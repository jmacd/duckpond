# EXPERIMENT: An incremental MIRROR pull applies an upstream delta (new file +
#             new series version) and preserves full replica identity.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   724 restores a whole pond, then its "incremental" second pull is a NO-OP
#   short-circuit (nothing changed upstream).  726 exercises the incremental
#   series-version diff but in cross-pond IMPORT mode (the consumer keeps its
#   OWN pond_id and mounts the foreign tree; tips never converge).  Neither
#   drives `rebuild_pond`'s incremental node_id diff in MIRROR mode with REAL
#   upstream changes: a restored replica that must apply a delta and remain a
#   byte-identical mirror (same pond_id, same content TIP).
#
#   This test closes that gap.  A producer publishes a pond; a consumer
#   `pond restore`s it (adopting the source pond_id).  The producer then makes
#   TWO kinds of change in one further push -- a brand-new file (a Create diff)
#   and a new VERSION appended to an existing series (a Version diff) -- and the
#   consumer runs a plain `pond pull` on the mirror.  The incremental
#   `plan_node_diff` must apply BOTH ops to the existing mirror, and the mirror
#   must converge back onto the producer's new content TIP (the canonical
#   cross-replica fingerprint, per 718/724).  This is the only case that proves
#   an already-materialized mirror stays a faithful replica across an
#   incremental update, not just across a from-scratch restore.
#
# EXPECTED:
#   - After restore: mirror has the file and series v1 (7 rows); tip == producer.
#   - Producer adds /data/b.txt and appends series v2; auto-push.
#   - After `pond pull origin`: mirror gains b.txt, series shows BOTH versions
#     (14 rows), the original file is unchanged, and the mirror tip again equals
#     the producer's pushed tip.
#   - Restored mirror passes its own `pond fsck`.
#
# History:
#   Added on jmacd/65 to cover incremental MIRROR-mode diff application, a gap
#   left by 724 (no-op second pull) and 726 (import mode, no tip convergence).
