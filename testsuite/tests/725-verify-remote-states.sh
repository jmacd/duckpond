# EXPERIMENT: `pond verify` reports the commit-graph relationship between the
#             local tip and a remote's published tip, and compaction is
#             transparent to that relationship (D9).
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   The content-addressed remote holds one tip ref per pond; `pond verify`
#   places the remote tip against the local content tip and reports:
#     * UpToDate     -- remote tip == local content tip.
#     * RemoteBehind -- remote tip is an ANCESTOR of the local tip (local has
#                       unpushed content commits); reports the unpushed count.
#     * Diverged     -- remote tip is not in local history (real mismatch).
#
#   Under D9 the content tip is the last CONTENT-CHANGING commit.  Compaction
#   (`pond maintain --compact`) is content-preserving: it rewrites local
#   storage but leaves the logical content byte-identical, so it adds NO commit
#   to the content graph and does NOT advance the tip.  Therefore compaction
#   must NOT move verify into RemoteBehind -- it stays UpToDate, and a push
#   after it is a harmless no-op.  This test locks that invariant in from the
#   CLI so a regression to "compaction is a pushable commit" is caught.
#
#   The RemoteBehind ancestor-walk and `local_unpushed` count are covered
#   directly by the Rust unit test `test_remote_cli.rs` (RemoteBehind by 1);
#   that state is not cleanly reachable from the CLI because every content
#   write auto-pushes to a push-mode backup.
#
# EXPECTED:
#   - After backup add (auto-push): verify reports UpToDate.
#   - After a further content write (auto-push): verify stays UpToDate.
#   - After maintain --compact: verify stays UpToDate (NOT RemoteBehind).
#   - A push after compaction completes and leaves verify UpToDate.
#
# History:
#   Added on jmacd/65 for the RemoteBehind verify state.  Rewritten under D9:
#   compaction adds no commit, so its old "RemoteBehind by 1 after compact"
#   premise is invalid; this now asserts compaction is transparent to verify.
