# EXPERIMENT: Producer-side compaction is transparent to replication (D9)
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Exercises `pond maintain --compact` under the D9 content-addressed model,
#   where compaction is a LOCAL physical optimization (merging series versions
#   / rewriting parquet) that leaves the logical content -- and therefore the
#   content tip -- byte-identical.  Compaction adds no commit to the content
#   graph, exactly as `git gc`/repack adds no commits.  Consequences on a
#   file:// remote (self-contained; no compose):
#     1. Producer P1: ingest several files, `pond backup add origin`
#        (auto-pushes each write, so the remote already holds the tip).
#     2. `pond maintain --compact` reclaims local storage; it reports the
#        content is unchanged and replicas need no update.
#     3. `pond verify origin` is clean (UpToDate) AFTER compaction WITHOUT any
#        push -- the content tip is unchanged, so it was already replicated.
#     4. `pond push origin` is a harmless no-op that still completes and keeps
#        verify UpToDate (re-sending the unchanged closure is idempotent).
#     5. A fresh consumer P2 cross-pond imports and pulls and sees identical
#        file content (md5): compaction did not disturb the replicated data.
#     6. `pond status` reflects identity + the backup remote post-compact.
#
# EXPECTED:
#   - maintain --compact reports a compaction commit and that replicas need
#     no update.
#   - verify is UpToDate right after compaction, with no intervening push.
#   - a follow-up push completes and leaves verify UpToDate.
#   - the consumer reproduces producer content exactly.
#
# History:
#   Added on jmacd/52 to cover `Ship::compact` / `pond maintain --compact`.
#   Rewritten under D9: compaction is content-preserving and transparent to
#   the content graph, so it adds no commit and needs no push to replicate.
