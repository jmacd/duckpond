# EXPERIMENT: `pond fsck` as a replica-comparison fingerprint.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   fsck's headline use case is "verify two replicas are identical."  The
#   content root is a tree_hash over each pond's root_tree_hash (a directory
#   is a partition; its recursive content tree_hash is its digest), so it is a
#   lineage-independent fingerprint of a pond's content.  This test pins down
#   exactly what "comparable" means -- and the scope limit baked into the
#   design.  Two parts, both self-contained (the replication half uses a
#   file:// remote, no compose):
#
#   PART A -- byte replica, TOP-LEVEL root equality:
#     1. Build a pond with an inline file and an incompressible large-file
#        blob; record its fsck root.
#     2. `cp -r` the entire pond to a new location and fsck the copy: the
#        root is IDENTICAL (location-independent; a true replica matches by
#        root alone, which is the documented compare-by-root workflow).
#     3. --quick roots also match (the root is structural, content pass does
#        not move it).
#     4. Diverge the copy (add a file) -> roots now DIFFER, so the root
#        detects replica divergence.
#     5. Corrupt the copy's blob -> the copy's default fsck FAILS while its
#        --quick (structural) pass still passes -- the content pass is what
#        closes that gap, even on a replica.
#
#   PART B -- replication-produced replica, PARTITION-level equality:
#     6. Producer pushes to a file:// remote; a consumer cross-pond imports
#        and pulls.  The consumer keeps its OWN pond_id and mounts the
#        producer's data, so the two TOP-LEVEL roots legitimately differ
#        (the consumer folds in its own pond_id partition as well as the
#        producer's) -- a content-only fingerprint this is NOT.
#     7. But every one of the producer's per-partition digests
#        (pond_id/part_id rows=N tree_hash) reappears VERBATIM in the
#        consumer's `fsck --verbose` output: content-addressed replication
#        preserved pond_id, part_id, and content tree hashes byte-for-byte.
#     8. Mutate the producer + re-push/re-pull -> the producer's partition
#        digests change AND the consumer re-converges to the new digests.
#
# EXPECTED:
#   - Byte-replica fsck roots match exactly and track divergence.
#   - Corruption on a replica is caught by the content pass, invisible to
#     --quick.
#   - A replication-produced consumer reproduces every producer partition
#     digest exactly, and stays converged across incremental pushes, even
#     though the consumer's top-level root differs by design.
#
# History:
#   Added on jmacd/65 alongside `pond fsck` to give the replica-comparison
#   guarantee end-to-end coverage (047-fsck.sh only exercises a single pond).
#   Uses a file:// remote so it runs in the base container without compose.
