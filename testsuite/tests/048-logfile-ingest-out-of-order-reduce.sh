# EXPERIMENT: logfile-ingest of OUT-OF-ORDER data feeding temporal-reduce.
# DESCRIPTION: Reproduces the recurring watershop production failure where a
#   collector flushes a buffered older sample AFTER a newer one, so the active
#   log file grows with a late, earlier-timestamped record. logfile-ingest is
#   strictly append-only: it stores each run's new tail as a new
#   FilePhysicalSeries version, faithfully preserving the collector's write
#   order. The late record therefore lands in a LATER source version whose
#   earliest time bucket PRECEDES a bucket already sealed by an earlier version.
#
#   The temporal-reduce incremental rollup used to reject this with:
#
#     temporal-reduce rollup: source node ... backfills already-sealed buckets
#     (earliest bucket ... precedes frontier ...); ... Re-run the export with
#     --rebuild ...
#
#   which froze every reduced read at the frontier until a manual
#   `pond export --rebuild`. The fix recognizes that FilePhysicalSeries versions
#   are DISJOINT append deltas, so per-version partials merge by GROUP BY
#   time_bucket regardless of arrival order; the sequentiality guard now applies
#   only to overlapping (non-series) sources.
#
# EXPECTED: Reading the reduced 1h series succeeds (no sealed-bucket error) and
#   the late-arriving earlier bucket is present with correct aggregates, exactly
#   as a single-pass GROUP BY would compute.
