# Septic Station Monitor

## About

This site monitors an Orenco septic system via Modbus registers,
collected by an [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/)
running on a BeaglePlay ARM64 board (`septicplaystation.local`),
exported as OtelJSON, and ingested into
[DuckPond](https://github.com/jmacd/caspar.water).
