# DuckPond - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

ALWAYS review the [project overview](../crates/docs/duckpond-overview.md) 
before writing new code.

Always avoid duplication; we prefer fail fast as
[documented](../crates/docs/anti-duplication.md).

Always avoid fallbacks; we prefer fail fast as
[documented](../crates/docs/fallback-antipattern-philosophy.md).

When running tests with large diagnostic outputs, 
use the [large output debugging](../crates/docs/large-output-debugging.md) 
technique.
