# DuckPond - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

ALWAYS review the (project overview)[../crates/docs/duckpond-overview.md]
before writing new code.

Always avoid fallbacks; we prefer fail fast as
[documented](../crates/docs/fallback-antipattern-philosophy.md).

The diagnostics library is tricky to use, ALWAYS read the [diagnostics
instructions](../.github/instructions/diagnostics.md) before using the
library.
