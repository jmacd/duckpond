# Sitegen full-site build: memory profile and incremental-export plan

Status: analysis. Code-grounded as of 2026-07-01. Measurements taken on
watershop against a copy of the prod site pond (pond 0.52.0). Citations use
`crate/file.rs:line`. Nothing here is implemented yet.

Goal: run the whole Caspar Water site build (sitegen exporting from the site
pond, which imports the water/septic/noyo subponds) on a low-memory machine.
This document captures what was measured, how to reproduce the sampling, the
root cause, and a prioritized plan to cut the peak.

Related: `efficiency-dataflow.md` (§5.2, §6 candidates 6.2/6.3),
`incremental-rollup-implementation.md`, `sitegen-design.md`.

## 1. Key measurements

- Peak: **~2148 MB tracked heap (PEAK_ALLOC) / ~2629 MB RSS**. Prod journal
  `Run summary`: `peak_mem_mb=2148, elapsed_s=667`.
- RSS runs ~0.5 GB above tracked heap due to mmap'd parquet, ~60 thread stacks,
  and glibc arena fragmentation. RSS is the number that OOMs a small board.
- The peak is set entirely in the **first ~50 s**, after which RSS is flat
  (glibc allocator retention; freed pages are not returned):
  - t=0->14s -> 2159 MB: the 5 water `metrics` `1m` exports, each fanning out
    to **1381 day-partitions**.
  - t=14->50s -> 2626 MB: the `analysis` stage (pump-cycles / cycle-summary),
    a full-history recompute.
  - The noyo subsite does NOT raise the peak (it recomputes cold but plateaus).
- Cheap allocator lever, independent of this plan: `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` plus
  128K trim/mmap thresholds cut peak RSS 2629 -> 1463 MB (44%), measured.

## 2. How to reproduce the sampling

The live ponds run as **podman containers** (image
`ghcr.io/jmacd/duckpond/duckpond:{prod,latest}-arm64`), with the pond in podman
volumes `pond-site-{prod,staging}` mounted at `/pond`, driven by systemd user
timers `pond@<instance>.timer` -> `config/scripts/run.sh <instance>`.

Host: `watershop.casparwater.us`, 12 cores, 64 GB, aarch64 Linux, passwordless
sudo.

Reproduce against a COPY so the live pond is never touched:

1. Copy the pond volume data:
   `sudo cp -a <podman volume>/pond-site-prod/_data /tmp/prof-pond`.
2. Extract the matching binary from the image. The host `/usr/bin/pond` is a
   DIFFERENT 0.52.0 build and rejects the newer node config via
   `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` ("No sitegen factory config found in YAML"):
   `podman cp $(podman create <image>):/usr/local/bin/pond /tmp/pond-image`.
3. Optional (only needed to finish the build; the peak is reached before this):
   extract the image `/usr/local/share/duckpond/vendor` to the host same path,
   or the build errors at the final asset-copy step.
4. samply CPU profile: `sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1`, then run under
   `samply record --unstable-presymbolicate --save-only -o out.json -- <build cmd>`.
   samply 0.13.1 is CPU-only (no memory flag). The binary has `.symtab` but no
   DWARF, so `--unstable-presymbolicate` (which writes an `out.json.syms.json`
   sidecar) is REQUIRED for offline symbolication.
5. RSS timeline: run the build and sample `/proc/<pid>/VmRSS` every ~0.3 s.

Build command (whole site, three subponds):

```
POND=/tmp/prof-pond SITE_BASE_URL=/ RUST_LOG=info POND_MAX_ALLOC_MB=3000 \
  /tmp/pond-image run /system/etc/90-sitegen build <outdir>
```

`run.sh` also does content/template/img pulls and `pull water/noyo/septic`
first; those do not affect the export peak.

Cleanup after sampling: `sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2`; remove
`/tmp/prof-pond`, `/tmp/pond-image`, and the host `/usr/local/share/duckpond`
if it was added.

Gotchas:
- `/usr/bin/time` is not installed on watershop.
- The host-binary vs image-binary schema mismatch (step 2) is the first trap.
- `RUST_LOG=warn` suppresses the `Peak memory usage: NN MB` line; use `info`.

Instrumentation already in the tree: `PanicOnLargeAlloc` wrapping
`peak_alloc::PeakAlloc` (`crates/cmd/src/panic_alloc.rs`, default cap
`POND_MAX_ALLOC_MB=3000`); the `Peak memory usage: NN MB` line at exit
(`crates/cmd/src/main.rs`); selfmon scrapes it into `sitegen_peak_rss.bytes`.

---

## 3. Root cause

- `crates/provider/src/export.rs:319-362` -- `export_series_to_parquet` /
  `export_table_provider_to_parquet` do `remove_dir_all(export_dir)` then
  `COPY (SELECT *) TO ... PARTITIONED BY (...)`: a full O(history) rewrite of
  ALL partitions every build. The `remove_dir_all` exists to avoid DataFusion's
  UUID-named COPY output accumulating duplicate files, so incrementalizing it
  requires deterministic per-partition file names plus reconciliation, not just
  dropping the wipe. Peak memory here is the demux holding many concurrent
  partition writers (1381 for a 1m series).
- `crates/sitegen/src/factory.rs:1031-1190` -- `run_queryable_file_export`: the
  per-series export loop. `node_path` is in scope, so the source
  `NodeMetadata.version` is cheaply available at the call site as a change key.
- `crates/provider/src/factory/temporal_reduce.rs:1127-1148` -- `merge_sql` is a
  `GROUP BY date_bin` over ALL cached finest partials, once per resolution
  (O(history/interval) x N resolutions), materializing all buckets to find the
  frontier.

### Change-key primitives (the "pond-sha")

The keys needed to skip unchanged work already exist:

- Per-series: `OplogEntry.version` (`crates/tlogfs/src/schema.rs:221`) exposed as
  `NodeMetadata.version` (`crates/tinyfs/src/metadata.rs`); bumps on every append.
- Content hash: `FileVersionInfo.blake3` (cumulative bao). The existing rollup
  and format caches already key on `(version, blake3)`
  (`crates/provider/src/rollup_cache.rs`, `crates/provider/src/format_cache.rs`)
  under `{POND}/cache/`, which persists across builds.
- Affected time range per version: `OplogEntry.min_event_time` /
  `max_event_time` (`crates/tlogfs/src/schema.rs:244`) -- only frontier
  partitions can change; historical day/month/quarter partitions are immutable.
- Whole-pond gate: `PondTxnMetadata.txn_seq` + `DeltaTable::version()`
  (`crates/tlogfs/src/persistence.rs`).

### Blocker

`config/scripts/run.sh` (site case) builds into a FRESH `build-<timestamp>`
directory each run, symlinks `current`, and keeps the last 3. Exports are never
reused across builds. Incremental export requires seeding the new build from
`current` plus a manifest of which source version each partition was built from.

## 4. Potential (daily incremental tick)

| | Full rebuild (today) | Daily incremental |
|---|---|---|
| Partition files written | ~7,470 (water 7,280, analysis 10, septic 36, noyo ~144) | ~30-50 |
| 1m export fan-out | 1381 writers/series | 1-2 writers/series |
| Peak live heap | ~2.1 GB | MB-scale (one day of aggregated rows) |

Per-series changed partitions on a daily tick: 1m -> current day; 10m -> current
month; 1h -> current quarter; 6h/1d -> current year (~0.5% of partitions).

Bounding the MEMORY peak needs BOTH changes, which compose: the merged-output
cache bounds the aggregation working set, and the incremental export bounds the
write fan-out. The `analysis` stage is a SEPARATE O(history) computation and may
still hold the peak after export and merge are fixed -- confirm its share first.

---

## 5. Prioritized plan

- **P0 -- Allocator tuning (cheap, independent).** `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` (+128K
  trim/mmap thresholds) or jemalloc/mimalloc in the container/systemd env.
  Measured 44% RSS cut. Does not reduce true heap demand; buys headroom while
  the incremental work is built.
- **P1 -- Measure the `analysis` stage's exact peak contribution.** Re-run the
  sampling (§2) and read RSS at the metrics/analysis boundary. Decides whether
  P3+P4 alone reach the target (e.g. 1 GB) or P5 is also required.
- **P2 -- Manifest + seed-from-current (enabler, no algorithm change).** Write a
  per-partition manifest recording `(node_id, version, blake3, time-range)`; seed
  the new build directory from `current` (copy/hardlink `data/`). Touches
  `run.sh` and a small manifest reader/writer.
- **P3 -- Incremental export write** (`efficiency-dataflow.md` 6.3). Deterministic
  per-partition file names (replacing DataFusion's UUID output); skip partitions
  whose source `(version, blake3)` is unchanged; only rewrite frontier
  partitions. Biggest single win for both memory and time.
- **P4 -- Merged-output cache** (`efficiency-dataflow.md` 6.2). Cache
  per-resolution merged buckets keyed like the partial cache; only the frontier
  bucket and newly-added buckets recompute. Bounds the aggregation working set so
  the export's frontier-only path is truly O(delta).
- **P5 -- Incrementalize the `analysis` stage** if P1 shows it still holds the
  peak (pump-cycles / cycle-summary full-history recompute).

Note: the noyo subsite recomputes cold every build (~15 s/series, ~340 s of wall
time) -- a TIME cost, not a memory-peak cost. Separate optimization (a subsite
export cache).
