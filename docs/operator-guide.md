# DuckPond Operator Guide

This guide is for the person who keeps a DuckPond running: creating
ponds, attaching remotes, replicating, running maintenance, monitoring
health, and recovering from failures.

It assumes familiarity with the data commands (`pond copy`, `pond cat`,
`pond list`, `pond mknod`, `pond run`).  For the full command/flag
reference see [docs/cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md); for the design
rationale behind the remote model see
[docs/remote-redesign.md](remote-redesign.md).

> This guide reflects the post-D6 CLI.  The pre-D6 factory-based remote
> model (`pond sync`, `pond remote add <yaml>`, `/sys/run/<N>-backup`,
> `import:` config sections, `pond context`) is gone; the historical
> version is archived at
> [docs/archive/operator-guide-pre-d6.md](archive/operator-guide-pre-d6.md).

## 1. Concepts

A **pond** is a transactional, query-native filesystem backed by Delta
Lake.  Every write is one atomic transaction recorded in the Delta
commit log.

A **remote** is an S3-compatible bucket or a local directory that holds
replicated copies of a pond's transactions as **bundles**.  Two kinds of
attachment exist, distinguished only by direction:

| Attachment | Command | Direction | Use |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Backup** | `pond backup add` | push (or push+pull) | Send this pond's writes to an offsite copy |
| **Remote** | `pond remote add` | pull | Receive another pond's data (mirror or import) |

A pull remote attaches at a **mount path**:

- **Mirror** (`PATH = /`): the remote's `store_id` equals this pond's
  `pond_id`.  This pond is a replica of the producer; pulled data lands
  as this pond's own data.
- **Cross-pond import** (`PATH = /imports/<name>`): the remote's
  `store_id` differs from this pond's `pond_id`.  The foreign pond's
  data is mounted read-through at the configured path, alongside this
  pond's own data.

### Universal vs. per-replica state

| Kind | Examples | Where it lives | Replicated? |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Universal** | User data, factory configs, `/sys/remotes/<name>` attachment YAML | Data Delta table | Yes (push/pull) |
| **Per-replica** | Pond identity cache, remote modes, push/pull watermarks | Control table | No |

The **data table** is canonical and replicable.  The **control table**
is a per-instance cache and audit log; it is disposable and can be
rebuilt from the data table (see [§6 Recovery](#6-recovery)).

### Transaction lifecycle states

Each transaction is recorded in the control table as a sequence of
lifecycle records.  `pond log` and `pond log --txn-seq N` surface them:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Begin` | Transaction started. |
| `DataCommitted` | The data Delta commit landed; this is the terminal record for a successful **write**. Carries the Delta version + partition checksums. |
| `Completed` | A read (or no-op write) finished cleanly. |
| `Failed` | The transaction aborted; the reason is in the record metadata. |
| `PostPushPending` / `PostPushStarted` / `PostPushCompleted` / `PostPushFailed` | Lifecycle of the post-commit auto-push of one write to one push/both-mode remote. |

A transaction with a `Begin` but no terminal record is **incomplete**
(the process crashed mid-write); `pond recover` resolves it.

## 2. On-disk and filesystem layout

```
{POND}/
  data/                     Data Delta table (the filesystem itself; replicable)
    _delta_log/             Transaction log + pond_txn commit metadata
    _large_files/           Content-addressed store for files >64KB
    pond_id=<uuid>/part_id=<uuid>/   Partitions (one per directory)
  control/                  Control table (per-replica; NOT replicated)
    _delta_log/
```

In-pond system paths:

```
/sys/                       Steward-owned (replicated)
  remotes/<name>            Remote/backup attachment YAML (one per attachment)
/system/                    cmd-owned factory nodes (replicated)
  run/                      Auto-executing factories (run after each commit)
  etc/                      Manually triggered factories (pond run)
  site/                     Static content (templates)
/...                        User data
```

> Note the two separate trees: **`/sys/remotes/`** holds remote
> attachments (managed by `pond remote`/`pond backup`); **`/system/run`**
> and **`/system/etc`** hold factory nodes (managed by `pond mknod`/`pond
> run`).  Do not confuse them.

---

## 3. Setup

### Create a pond

```
$ export POND=/data/mysite
$ pond init
```

`$POND` (or `--pond <path>`) selects the pond for every command.

### Attach a backup (push side)

A backup mirrors the whole pond to an offsite copy.  Push-only by
default; `--bidirectional` makes it push+pull.

```
# Local directory backup
$ pond backup add origin file:///backups/mysite

# S3 backup.  Credentials must be `${env:VAR}` references (single-quoted so
# the shell does NOT expand them): the attachment config is replicated to
# every backup, so a literal secret would be exposed on all replicas.  Each
# replica resolves the value from its own environment at use time.  A literal
# `secret_access_key` is rejected at attach time.
$ pond backup add origin s3://my-bucket/mysite \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --access-key-id '${env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}' \
    --secret-access-key '${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'

# MinIO / R2 / other S3-compatible endpoint
$ pond backup add origin s3://my-bucket/mysite \
    --endpoint http://minio.local:9000 --allow-http \
    --access-key-id '${env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}' \
    --secret-access-key '${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

Attaching auto-initializes the remote (creates the Delta table stamped
with this pond's `pond_id`).  From then on, **every write transaction is
automatically pushed** to push/both-mode backups after it commits (the
steward scans `/sys/remotes/*` post-commit).  You only run `pond push`
manually to retry after a failure.

### Attach a pull remote (replica or import)

```
# Mirror restart: this pond is a replica of the producer (same pond_id)
$ pond remote add upstream s3://my-bucket/mysite /

# Cross-pond import: mount a foreign pond's data read-through
$ pond remote add septic s3://other-bucket/septic /imports/septic
```

The first `pond pull` from a cross-pond remote materializes the mount
entry at the configured path automatically.

### List and detach

```
$ pond remote list                 # all attachments (push + pull)
$ pond backup list                 # push-side attachments only

$ pond remote remove upstream      # detach: drop YAML + watermarks
$ pond remote remove --purge septic  # also drop the cross-pond mount entry
```

---

## 4. Routine operation

### Push and pull

```
# Manually push pending writes to push/both remotes (retry after failure)
$ pond push                # all push/both remotes
$ pond push origin         # one named remote

# Pull new bundles from pull/both remotes
$ pond pull                # all pull/both remotes
$ pond pull upstream       # one named remote
```

Push/both backups are pushed automatically after each commit, so
`pond push` is normally only needed to recover from a transient failure.
Pulls are always manual (or scripted via cron -- see [§7](#7-cron--systemd)).

### Maintenance

`pond maintain` runs Delta Lake housekeeping (checkpoint + vacuum) on the
**local** data and control tables.  `--compact` additionally merges
small parquet files into fewer large ones.

```
$ pond maintain
$ pond maintain --compact
```

`--compact` records the data-table merge as a **Compact transaction**, so
the next `pond push` emits a Compact bundle that backups can use as a
restart baseline (see [§6](#6-recovery)).  Push before (or right after)
compacting so the baseline reaches your backup.

> `pond maintain` operates on the local pond only; it does not push to or
> prune remotes.  Remote-side bundle retention is not currently exposed as
> a `pond` CLI command.

---

## 5. Monitoring

### Status

`pond status` is a fast, offline health aggregate (it reads only the
local control table and `/sys/remotes/*` -- no network).

```
$ pond status
Pond Status
===========

Identity
  Pond ID:   019e9b27-d392-7506-b875-b096dc5a41af
  Created:   2026-06-06 04:18:59 UTC by jmacd@host
  Location:  /data/mysite

Local state
  Last write seq:  4
  Recovery:        OK (no incomplete transactions)

Remotes (1)
  origin  [push]
    url:          s3://my-bucket/mysite
    mount:        / (mirror)
    last pushed:  4 (up to date)
```

Push "lag" (`up to date` / `behind local by N txn` / `never pushed`) is
computed from local watermarks.  To cross-check against what the remote
actually recorded, use `pond verify`.

### Verify

`pond verify` compares this pond's current live data against a remote's
recorded partition checksums.

```
$ pond verify origin
[OK] verify origin: live data matches remote at seq=4
```

A mismatch prints per-partition detail and the divergence boundary.

> Verify is symmetric: a replica bootstrapped from a remote verifies
> cleanly against it (the producer's `pond_init` transaction is replicated
> as a normal bundle, so the replica is byte-identical).

### Transaction log

```
$ pond log                 # recent transactions (default 10)
$ pond log --limit 50
$ pond log --txn-seq 42    # full lifecycle detail for one transaction
$ pond log --incomplete    # transactions that need `pond recover`
```

`pond log` reconstructs, for each write transaction, the originating CLI
command (from the `pond_txn` metadata in the data Delta commit), the
timing and status (from the control table), and a one-line change summary
(files/directories/partitions touched, from the data table).  Pure reads
are omitted; crashed writes appear under `pond log --incomplete`.

### Configuration

```
$ pond config              # pond ID, creation, factory modes, settings
$ pond config set <key> <value>
```

---

## 6. Recovery

### Crash recovery (incomplete transaction)

If a write crashes mid-flight, the next command reports an incomplete
transaction.  `pond recover` marks it resolved and restores consistency.

```
$ pond recover
```

### Rebuild a lost control table

If the control table is lost or corrupt (but the data table survives),
the pond can no longer be opened.  `pond rebuild-control` reconstructs
the control table from the data Delta table's commit history.

```
$ pond rebuild-control          # control table is missing
$ pond rebuild-control --force  # move an existing (corrupt) one aside first
```

It recovers pond identity and the transaction-log skeleton.  It does
**not** recover operator settings (remote modes, watermarks) or per-txn
checksums, so afterwards you must **re-attach remotes** and treat
`pond verify` as re-baselined.  See
[cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md#pond-rebuild-control-d63) for the
full recovery semantics.

### Consumer fell below the retention horizon

If `pond pull` fails with "consumer is below retention horizon", the
bundles you still need were pruned by retention.  Recover by
re-bootstrapping from the remote's oldest compact baseline:

```
$ pond restart-from-compact upstream
```

A mirror restart drops all local data and rebuilds (the attachment is
re-persisted automatically); a cross-pond restart drops only the foreign
pond's footprint.

> Producing a baseline: run `pond maintain --compact` on the producer and
> `pond push`.  The compaction is pushed as a Compact bundle that becomes
> the remote's restart baseline.  A pure duckpond mirror with no compacted
> push (and no compacting upstream) has no baseline yet, and the command
> reports "no compact bundle".

### Destructive recovery

`pond emergency` provides destructive recovery operations (e.g. erasing
a remote bucket).  Use with care; see `pond emergency --help`.

## 7. Cron / systemd

### Data collection (factory) every minute

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/duckpond-collect
* * * * *  duckpond  POND=/data/mysite pond run 20-hydrovu collect 2>&1 | logger -t duckpond
```

### Replica pull every 5 minutes

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/duckpond-pull
*/5 * * * *  duckpond  POND=/data/replica pond pull 2>&1 | logger -t duckpond-pull
```

### Weekly compaction

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/duckpond-maintain
0 3 * * 0  duckpond  POND=/data/mysite pond maintain --compact 2>&1 | logger -t duckpond-maintain
```

### systemd oneshot + timer

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/duckpond-collect.service
[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=duckpond
Environment=POND=/data/mysite
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pond run 20-hydrovu collect
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/duckpond-collect.timer
[Timer]
OnCalendar=minutely
Persistent=true
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

> Scripts and cron jobs should set `$POND` explicitly rather than relying
> on any interactive default.

## 8. Runbook

### "A backup push failed"

```
$ pond status          # shows the backup `behind local by N txn`
$ pond push origin     # retry
$ pond status          # back to `up to date`
```

### "Replica is behind"

```
$ pond pull upstream
$ pond status
```

### "Replica pull says 'below retention horizon'"

```
$ pond restart-from-compact upstream
```

### "Control table is corrupt / pond won't open"

```
$ pond rebuild-control --force
# then re-attach remotes:
$ pond backup add origin s3://my-bucket/mysite ...
```

### "Disk is filling up"

```
$ pond maintain --compact
```

### "Transaction failed, data looks inconsistent"

```
$ pond log --incomplete
$ pond recover
```

### "Is my backup actually consistent?"

```
$ pond verify origin     # run on the producer side
```

## 10. Future direction: content-addressed sync

> This section is **forward-looking**.  It describes the operator-visible
> end-state of the content-addressed (CA) migration, not current behavior.
> Nothing here ships until the parity gate in the migration plan passes.  The
> design is in [content-addressed-pond-design.md](content-addressed-pond-design.md);

> sections above remain authoritative.

Today a pond replicates as a stream of per-transaction **bundles**
(manifest + checksums + data), and each remote tracks a `(pond_id, seq)`
**frontier**.  Under content-addressed sync the pond becomes a store of
immutable, hash-named objects -- blobs (file/series bytes), trees
(directories), and commits (one per transaction, carrying provenance) -- and
replication transfers only the objects a peer is missing.  The shipped command
surface (`pond push` / `pull` / `verify` / `status` / `maintain`) is preserved;
what changes is the meaning behind it.

### What changes for you

- **Frontier becomes a commit hash.**  "last pushed seq" in `pond status` and
  the per-remote watermark become a single **tip commit hash** per ref.  Two
  ponds are identical exactly when their tip commit hashes (equivalently, their
  root tree hashes) match -- a single comparison instead of a per-partition
  checksum list.

- **Sync transfers objects, not bundles.**  Push/pull compare tip commits and
  exchange only the blobs and trees the other side lacks, addressed by hash.
  Identical content that already exists on the remote (even from a different
  pond or transaction) is not re-sent.  There is no per-transaction bundle to
  retain or prune; retention becomes "objects reachable from the commits you
  keep."

- **Verify localizes divergence.**  `pond verify` compares root tree hashes and,
  on mismatch, descends the tree to report the **specific divergent subtree**
  rather than a flat per-partition checksum diff.  A clean match is one hash
  comparison.

- **`fsck` / integrity becomes a CAS scrub.**  Integrity checking re-hashes each
  reachable object and confirms `name == hash` (plus byte-range chains for
  large blobs and reachability from a ref), replacing the two-level partition
  checksum Merkle.  Corruption is reported as the offending object hash.

- **Compaction is an ordinary rewrite commit.**  `pond maintain --compact` no
  longer emits a special "Compact bundle restart baseline"; it records a
  rewrite commit like any other write.  Recovering a replica that fell behind
  becomes "fetch from any commit the producer still retains," so
  `restart-from-compact` is subsumed by normal commit-DAG fetch.

- **Cross-pond import is a graft.**  Mounting a foreign pond attaches its commit
  chain by reference and pulls the reachable objects, instead of importing
  per-partition bundles.  Provenance (which pond/seq/author produced a commit)
  lives in the commit object and is still surfaced by `pond log`.

### What stays the same

- Single-writer-per-pond, so each pond is still a **linear commit chain** and
  push/pull are still fast-forward (no merge).
- The **data is canonical, the control table is disposable** -- you can still
  rebuild local bookkeeping from the data history.
- Credentials handling, attachment model (backup vs. remote), and the cron /
  systemd patterns in [§7](#7-cron--systemd) are unaffected.
