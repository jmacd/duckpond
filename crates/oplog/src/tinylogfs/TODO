Use simple ascending IDs not UUID4

Use Arrow RecordBatch, not Vec<Record>


In
```
    /// Query for a specific node by ID
    pub async fn get_node(&self, node_id: &str) -> Result<Option<OplogEntry>, TinyLogFSError> {
        let sql = format!(
            "SELECT part_id, timestamp, version, content FROM oplog WHERE part_id = '{}' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1",
            node_id
        );
```

(A) Part_ID is the parent dir node ID, what's missing?
(B) Use DF low-level API
