//! Content-graph fetch: the consumer side of the content-addressed remote
//! (design Section 8.5, Fork 2).
//!
//! This module implements the *fetch walk*: given a [`ContentRemote`] and its
//! tip commit, descend the object graph by `child_hash` and collect the
//! reachable, verified object closure.  It does no tlogfs rebuild yet; it
//! produces the in-memory [`FetchedGraph`] a rebuild consumes, and it is the
//! point at which content addressing is checked: every fetched object's bytes
//! are re-hashed and must equal the key they were fetched under.
//!
//! Descent is driven by [`EntryType`], exactly mirroring the producer's fold
//! (Section 9): physical directories are tree objects whose entries are
//! recursed into; physical files and symlinks are leaf blobs; series are
//! series objects whose version blobs are leaves; dynamic and computed nodes
//! are recipe leaves whose generated children are not in the graph.
