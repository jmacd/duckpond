//! Content-graph push: send a pond's reachable object closure plus its tip
//! commit to a [`ContentRemote`] (design Section 8, Decisions D6 and D7).
//!
//! This is the producer side of the single delta-managed content-addressed
//! remote.  A push is one atomic Delta commit on the remote that writes the
//! new object rows and advances the tip ref together; this module assembles
//! the objects to send and the tip to point at.
//!
//! The objects are: the inline tree closure from
//! [`materialize_content_objects`], the node manifest that commit references,
//! plus the tip commit object reproduced verbatim from the persisted commit
//! spine.  Large blobs (>64KB) live externally under `_large_files`, recorded
//! only by hash (Decision D7); this module reads each one's bytes locally and
//! sends it as a blob object keyed by its content hash, so the closure is
//! complete.

/// before being sent, so the remote tip can never disagree with the object it
