//! Read-side content-tree computation (the SPACE layer over live state).
//!
//! This module reads a pond's live filesystem and folds it into a single
//! `root_tree_hash` using the content-addressed object model from
//! [`sync_store::content`].  It is the read-only counterpart to the
//! commit-time fold described in `docs/content-addressed-pond-design.md`
//! Section 5: it proves the object model against real ponds and answers the
//! comparison question (Goal 2) -- two ponds (or two subtrees) are identical
//! iff their tree hashes match -- without persisting anything.
//!
//! # How it reads live state
//!
//! Like [`crate::fsck`], it scans the data table once.  A directory's *latest*
//! `OplogEntry` row stores its complete live entry set (Arrow IPC of
//! [`tlogfs::DirectoryEntry`]), so the current tree is reconstructed directly
//! from the latest row per node with no operation replay.  The fold then runs
//! bottom-up from the local pond's root.
//!
//! # `child_hash` by node kind (design Section 9)
//!
//! | Node kind                                   | `child_hash`                          |

//! | physical directory                          | recursive [`tree_hash`]               |
//! | physical file / table (single version)      | the version blob hash (`blake3`)      |
