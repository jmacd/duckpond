//! Content-tree comparison (design Section 6.2): "comparison falls out of the
//! tree."  Two ponds (or two subtrees) are identical iff their `root_tree_hash`
//! values match.  When they differ, this module descends by `child_hash` to the
//! divergent subtrees, doing work proportional to the difference rather than to
//! the size of either tree.
//!
//! Because the content tree is content-only (all lineage lives in the commit),
//! the comparison is independent of `pond_id`, sequence, and wall-clock time:
//! a clone and its origin compare equal, and two independently built ponds with
//! the same content compare equal.
