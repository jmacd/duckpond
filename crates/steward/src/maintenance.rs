//! Automatic Delta Lake table maintenance: checkpoint, vacuum, and compact.
//!
//! Every Delta table accumulates JSON commit log files and small parquet data
//! files over time.  Without periodic maintenance, opening a table requires
//! parsing *all* log files from scratch, causing linear growth in CPU and
//! memory.
//!
//! This module provides best-effort maintenance that runs after successful
//! write transactions:
//!
//! - **Checkpoint** -- collapse the JSON delta log into a single parquet
//!   checkpoint file.  Created every `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` versions (default 10).
//! - **Log cleanup** -- remove expired JSON log files older than the
//!   retention period (only after a checkpoint exists). The replicated data
//!   table uses its 30-day table default; the never-replicated control table
//!   uses a short retention so its high-churn log does not grow without bound.
//! - **Vacuum** -- delete parquet data files no longer referenced by the
//!   current table version. Runs every `VACUUM_INTERVAL` versions (default 10)
//!   to avoid unnecessary scans on every commit.
//! - **Compact** -- merge many small parquet files into fewer large ones
//!   (only on explicit request via `pond maintain --compact`).
