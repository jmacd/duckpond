//! Graft pin records -- the content-addressed reference a pond keeps to the
//! foreign tip it has grafted in (Section 8.5.2).
//!
//! A cross-pond import mounts a foreign pond's tree under its own pond_id but
//! deliberately OMITS that mount node from the content-tree fold, so the graft
//! is non-transitive: a downstream consumer that mirrors this pond never
//! re-replicates the foreign pond's closure.
//!
//! Omitting the mount node, however, would leave nothing in the content graph
//! recording WHICH foreign tip was grafted.  To make the graft a first-class,
//! content-addressed reference, each import also writes a small YAML pin file
//! at `/sys/grafts/<name>`.  That file is ordinary pond-owned content: it is
//! covered by this pond's commit hash and replicates to consumers through the
//! normal tree/push/pull path.  A consumer therefore learns the pinned foreign
//! tip without fetching the foreign pond's content -- an inert reference,
//! exactly like a git submodule pointer whose submodule has not been checked
//! out.
