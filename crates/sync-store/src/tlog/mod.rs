//! The transparency log (TIME): a SHA-256 RFC 6962 Merkle index over the
//! linear commit spine.
//!
//! The log is not a second structure -- it is the existing append-only sequence
//! of commits from the content graph, ordered by `seq`, indexed for proofs.
//! Design Section 7 fixes the seam precisely: the leaf payload is a commit
//! object (its BLAKE3 `root_tree_hash` plus provenance), and the log hashes
//! that leaf's serialization with **SHA-256**.  Internally the system never
//! leaves BLAKE3; SHA-256 appears only here, at the publishing boundary, so
//! off-the-shelf witnesses and verifiers can co-sign.
//!
//! ```text
//! content graph (SPACE, BLAKE3)        transparency log (TIME, SHA-256)
//!         commit_N  --------- leaf N ---------> hash_leaf(commit_N.encode())
//!            |                                          |
//!     root_tree_hash                            RFC 6962 Merkle over leaves
//! ```
//!
//! Tile materialization and checkpoint emission are implemented (design D5):
//! see [`tiles`] for the C2SP `tlog-tiles` layout and [`checkpoint`] for the
//! `tlog-checkpoint` note body.  Signing the checkpoint remains deferred with
//! the rest of the trust root (design Section 10).
