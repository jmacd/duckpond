## Blog

🚧 Caspar Water doesn't have a blog about water in Caspar. If we did, there's surely a rumor or two, about wells going dry or drill-rigs spotted drilling new wells. We could keep you posted on the proposed Fern Creek solar development.

🚧 A blog about software, though? The owner/operator could tell you that he works in open-source software, programs in Rust and Golang, works for Microsoft on the OpenTelemetry project, and other things about himself. He could talk about what a free, open-source water operating system would look like.
