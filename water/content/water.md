## Water

Caspar Water operates a single well for its modern-day system, however it has operated wells at several sites in its history. Our water treatment plant sits at the top of a hill spanning both the Jughandle creek and Caspar Creek watersheds, and Caspar Water's "sphere of influence" covers the historic village.

Our treatment system addresses two primary quality concerns. The raw water measures pH 5.9, which is slightly acidic and cause for concern because acidic water leaches copper and lead from metal pipes and fixtures. We also have relatively high organic iron content.

According to the results of a drawdown test at our primary well, we draw from an aquifer with transmissivity of 697 ft²/day. "This is one of the highest transmissivities I have seen in this area."

The test, performed at our primary well in December 2020 at the tail end of a years-long drought, estimated that our system has a sustainable capacity to draw 8 gallons per minute from each of its two wells.

It may help to think of 8 gallons per minute as 13 acre/ft per year. For an 18 acre water system at this rate, we require 9 inches of rainfall to recharge into the aquifer.
