## Operator

Caspar Water treatment is managed by Feiner Fixings. We measure and adjust chlorine levels weekly at the treatment plant and monthly at the Caspar Community Center. Following County guidelines, we perform routine bacteriological samples once per quarter.

Caspar Water distribution is managed by owner/operator Joshua MacDonald who has a California DWOCP grade 1 distribution license, #55555 (really!).
