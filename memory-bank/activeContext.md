# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Status: ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION PHASE + CLI TOOLING

We have successfully completed the foundational components and are now in the integration phase, combining TinyFS and OpLog to create the replacement architecture for the DuckPond proof-of-concept. Additionally, we have implemented a command-line interface for pond management operations.

## Current Focus: TinyFS + OpLog Integration

### Integration Objectives
1. **State Storage**: Store TinyFS directory state in OpLog Delta Lake partitions
2. **Query Interface**: SQL queries over filesystem operations and history
3. **Local Mirror**: Physical file synchronization from Delta Lake source of truth
4. **Command-line Tool**: Reconstruction and management utilities

### Integration Strategy
```rust
// Store tinyfs state as oplog entries
struct DirectoryEntry {
    name: String,
    node_id: String,
    file_type: FileType,
    // ... other metadata
}

// Partition by node_id for locality
node_id -> OpLog partition -> sequence of DirectoryEntry updates
```

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Define schema mapping between TinyFS nodes and OpLog entries
- [x] **CLI Tool Foundation**: Implemented `pond init` and `pond show` commands
- [ ] Implement TinyFS state serialization to OpLog
- [ ] Create deserialization path: OpLog â†’ TinyFS state reconstruction
- [ ] Basic read/write operations with persistence

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Incremental updates and delta operations
- [ ] Query interface for filesystem history
- [ ] Local mirror synchronization logic
- [ ] Performance optimization and batching
- [x] **CLI Extensions**: Foundation ready for additional commands

### Phase 3: Command-line Integration
- [x] **CLI tool for pond initialization and inspection**
- [ ] CLI tool for mirror management
- [ ] Backup and restore workflows
- [ ] Migration tools from proof-of-concept format
- [ ] Integration testing with real workloads

## Key Technical Decisions

### Schema Design
```rust
// OpLog Entry for TinyFS state
struct TinyFSEntry {
    operation_type: String,  // "create", "update", "delete"
    path: String,           // Full filesystem path
    node_type: String,      // "file", "directory", "symlink"
    content_hash: Option<String>, // For files
    target_path: Option<String>,  // For symlinks
    metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

### Partitioning Strategy
- **Partition Key**: `node_id` (directory identifier)
- **Sort Key**: `timestamp` (operation order)
- **Benefits**: Query locality, parallel processing, time travel

### State Reconstruction Algorithm
1. **Read Operations**: Query OpLog by node_id partition
2. **Apply Sequence**: Replay operations in timestamp order
3. **Build State**: Construct TinyFS directory structure
4. **Cache Results**: Memory-resident filesystem for performance

## Current Development Priorities

5. **CLI Enhancement**: Add file operations and advanced pond commands

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Incremental Updates**: Efficient delta operations
2. **Query Interface**: SQL access to filesystem history
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark with realistic data sizes
4. **Error Handling**: Robust recovery from corruption

### Medium-term Objectives (Next Month)
1. **Local Mirror**: Physical file synchronization
2. **CLI Tool**: User-facing management interface
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
4. **Documentation**: Usage guides and API reference
