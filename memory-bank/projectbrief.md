# DuckPond - Project Brief

## Project Overview
DuckPond is a "very small data lake" designed as a local-first, Parquet-oriented file system for timeseries data collection, processing, and analysis. The project consists of a proof-of-concept implementation (frozen) and new production-quality replacement crates.

## Core Mission
Build a local-first data system that:
- Collects timeseries data from environmental monitoring sources (HydroVu, LakeTech)
- Transforms data into standardized Arrow-based representations
- Stores data efficiently using Parquet format
- Enables fast querying and analysis using DuckDB/DataFusion
- Generates downsampled timeseries for web visualization
- Provides backup and restore capabilities

## Key Components

### Proof-of-Concept (./src) - FROZEN REFERENCE
- **Main binary**: Command-line interface for pond operations
- **Pond module**: Core data management with directory abstraction
- **HydroVu integration**: Environmental data collection from www.hydrovu.com
- **Backup/restore**: S3-compatible cloud backup system
- **Data pipeline**: YAML-driven resource configuration and processing

### Replacement Crates (./crates) - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#### 1. TinyFS Crate (`./crates/tinyfs`)
- **Purpose**: Virtual filesystem abstraction with pluggable storage backends
- **Architecture**: Backend trait system for clean separation of logic and storage
- **Core APIs**: `FS`, `WD` (working directory), `NodePath`, glob patterns
- **Advanced Features**: Dynamic directories via custom `Directory` trait implementations
- **Backend Architecture**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Pluggable storage system via `FilesystemBackend` trait
  - Core filesystem logic completely decoupled from storage implementation
  - `MemoryBackend` for testing and lightweight use (via dedicated `memory/` module)
  - Ready for `OpLogBackend` for persistent storage with Delta Lake
- **Key Innovation**: Clean architecture enabling different storage systems through dependency injection
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs unchanged, 22 tests passing

#### 2. OpLog Crate (`./crates/oplog`) 
- **Purpose**: Operation logging system using Delta Lake + DataFusion
- **Architecture**: Two-layer data storage (Delta Lake outer, Arrow IPC inner)
- **Features**: ACID guarantees, time travel, schema evolution, SQL queries
- **Status**: Implementation complete and tested

#### 3. CMD Crate (`./crates/cmd`)
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for pond management and operations
- **Features**: `pond init`, `pond show`, `pond cat`, `pond copy`, `pond mkdir`, enhanced diagnostics, error handling
- **Architecture**: Uses `clap` for CLI, integrates with TinyFS and OpLog
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Modernized interface with comprehensive functionality
- **Recent Updates**: Eliminated legacy commands, enhanced diagnostics, streamlined user experience

#### 4. TinyLogFS Integration (`./crates/oplog/src/tinylogfs/`) - âœ… **PRODUCTION READY WITH MODERN ARCHITECTURE**
- **Purpose**: Arrow-native filesystem backend providing Delta Lake persistence for TinyFS with unified directory entry handling
- **Architecture**: Complete implementation of clean two-layer design with modern, legacy-free codebase
- **Core Features**: 
  - **OpLogPersistence**: Real Delta Lake operations with DataFusion queries and ACID guarantees
  - **Factory Function**: `create_oplog_fs()` provides clean production API
  - **Unified Directory Handling**: Single `VersionedDirectoryEntry` type throughout system
  - **Modern Schema**: Clean, consistent struct definitions without legacy dual-type confusion
  - **Single Source of Truth**: All operations flow through persistence layer, no local state
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive I/O metrics and operation tracking
- **Production Validation**: All tests passing across all components, legacy code eliminated
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Modern architecture with reliable file operations
- **Key Achievement**: Eliminated legacy patterns, unified directory entry handling, enhanced CLI diagnostics
- **Current Phase**: âœ… **FULLY MODERNIZED** - Ready for production deployment with clean, maintainable codebase

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: MODERNIZED PRODUCTION SYSTEM READY**

### Complete System Modernization Achievement
The DuckPond system has successfully completed its comprehensive modernization and is now **production-ready** with:

- **Modern Architecture**: Legacy-free codebase with unified directory entry handling
- **Streamlined CLI**: Focused command set with enhanced diagnostics and error handling
- **Clean Schema**: Single `VersionedDirectoryEntry` type eliminates confusion
- **Reliable Operations**: ACID guarantees via Delta Lake, comprehensive error handling  
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Detailed oplog record display with version and timestamp information
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All tests passing, no legacy patterns remaining

### CLI Interface Modernized
- âœ… **Focused Commands**: Core operations only - `init`, `show`, `cat`, `copy`, `mkdir`
- âœ… **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Detailed oplog record information with partition, timestamp, version
- âœ… **Improved Error Handling**: Better validation and user feedback throughout
- âœ… **Legacy Elimination**: Removed unused `touch`, `commit`, `status` commands
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: All integration tests updated and passing with new output format

### Architecture Completely Modernized
- âœ… **Legacy Code Eliminated**: All deprecated `DirectoryEntry` patterns removed
- âœ… **Unified Directory Handling**: Single `VersionedDirectoryEntry` type throughout system
- âœ… **Clean Schema Definitions**: No dual/conflicting struct definitions
- âœ… **Modern Module Structure**: Clean exports with no references to deprecated types
- âœ… **Enhanced User Experience**: Better visibility and debugging capabilities

## Integration Success
The replacement crates work together with a proven modern architecture:

1. **TinyLogFS Modern Architecture**: Clean two-layer design with unified directory entry handling
2. **Enhanced Query Capabilities**: DataFusion integration with comprehensive operation logging
3. **Modernized CLI**: Focused command set with enhanced diagnostics and error handling
4. **Local-first Implementation**: Delta Lake provides reliable persistence with Arrow IPC efficiency
5. **Arrow-native Processing**: Complete stack uses consistent Arrow data representation
6. **Production Reliability**: ACID guarantees, comprehensive testing, and legacy-free codebase

## Current Focus
