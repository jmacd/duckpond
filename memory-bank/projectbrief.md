# DuckPond - Project Brief

## Project Overview
DuckPond is a "very small data lake" designed as a local-first, Parquet-oriented file system for timeseries data collection, processing, and analysis. The project consists of a proof-of-concept implementation (frozen) and new production-quality replacement crates with comprehensive Arrow Parquet integration and streaming capabilities.

## Recent Major Achievements ‚úÖ (July 19, 2025)
- **Complete Arrow Parquet Integration**: High-level ForArrow API and low-level RecordBatch operations
- **TinyFS Seek Support**: Unified AsyncRead + AsyncSeek architecture for efficient file operations  
- **Memory-Efficient Streaming**: Parquet display that scales to arbitrarily large files
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 128 tests passing including full end-to-end integration verification

## Core Mission
Build a local-first data system that:
- Collects timeseries data from environmental monitoring sources (HydroVu, LakeTech)
- Transforms data into standardized Arrow-based representations
- Stores data efficiently using Parquet format
- Enables fast querying and analysis using DuckDB/DataFusion
- Generates downsampled timeseries for web visualization
- Provides backup and restore capabilities
