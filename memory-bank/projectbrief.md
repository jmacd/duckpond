# DuckPond - Project Brief

## Project Overview
DuckPond is a "very small data lake" designed as a local-first, Parquet-oriented file system for timeseries data collection, processing, and analysis. The project consists of a proof-of-concept implementation (frozen) and new production-quality replacement crates.

## Core Mission
Build a local-first data system that:
- Collects timeseries data from environmental monitoring sources (HydroVu, LakeTech)
- Transforms data into standardized Arrow-based representations
- Stores data efficiently using Parquet format
- Enables fast querying and analysis using DuckDB/DataFusion
- Generates downsampled timeseries for web visualization
- Provides backup and restore capabilities

## Key Components

### Proof-of-Concept (./src) - FROZEN REFERENCE
- **Main binary**: Command-line interface for pond operations
- **Pond module**: Core data management with directory abstraction
- **HydroVu integration**: Environmental data collection from www.hydrovu.com
- **Backup/restore**: S3-compatible cloud backup system
- **Data pipeline**: YAML-driven resource configuration and processing

### Replacement Crates (./crates) - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#### 1. TinyFS Crate (`./crates/tinyfs`)
- **Purpose**: Virtual filesystem abstraction with pluggable storage backends
- **Architecture**: Backend trait system for clean separation of logic and storage
- **Core APIs**: `FS`, `WD` (working directory), `NodePath`, glob patterns
- **Advanced Features**: Dynamic directories via custom `Directory` trait implementations
- **Backend Architecture**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Pluggable storage system via `FilesystemBackend` trait
  - Core filesystem logic completely decoupled from storage implementation
  - `MemoryBackend` for testing and lightweight use (via dedicated `memory/` module)
  - Ready for `OpLogBackend` for persistent storage with Delta Lake
- **Key Innovation**: Clean architecture enabling different storage systems through dependency injection
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs unchanged, 22 tests passing

#### 2. OpLog Crate (`./crates/oplog`) 
- **Purpose**: Operation logging system using Delta Lake + DataFusion
- **Architecture**: Two-layer data storage (Delta Lake outer, Arrow IPC inner)
- **Features**: ACID guarantees, time travel, schema evolution, SQL queries
- **Status**: Implementation complete and tested

#### 3. CMD Crate (`./crates/cmd`)
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for pond management and operations
- **Features**: `pond init`, `pond show`, `pond copy`, environment integration, error handling
- **Architecture**: Uses `clap` for CLI, integrates with TinyFS and OpLog
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Streamlined interface with comprehensive functionality

#### 4. TinyLogFS Integration (`./crates/oplog/src/tinylogfs/`) - âœ… **PRODUCTION READY WITH CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**
- **Purpose**: Arrow-native filesystem backend providing Delta Lake persistence for TinyFS with clean single-source-of-truth architecture
- **Architecture**: Complete implementation of clean two-layer design (PersistenceLayer + FS coordinator)
- **Core Features**: 
  - **OpLogPersistence**: Real Delta Lake operations with DataFusion queries and ACID guarantees
  - **Factory Function**: `create_oplog_fs()` provides clean production API
  - **Directory Versioning**: VersionedDirectoryEntry with ForArrow implementation for Arrow-native mutations
  - **Single Source of Truth**: All operations flow through persistence layer, no local state
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive I/O metrics and operation tracking
- **Production Validation**: 49 tests passing across all components, critical bugs resolved
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Clean architecture with reliable file operations
- **Key Achievement**: Eliminated dual state management, fixed duplicate record bugs, streamlined user interface
- **Current Phase**: âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Ready for production deployment with intuitive CLI

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT READY**

### Complete System Achievement
The DuckPond system has successfully completed its development and is now **production-ready** with:

- **Clean Architecture**: Single source of truth with proper separation of concerns
- **Reliable Operations**: ACID guarantees via Delta Lake, comprehensive error handling  
- **Intuitive Interface**: Streamlined CLI with single human-readable output format
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 49 tests passing, no critical bugs remaining
- **Real-world Validation**: File copy operations working correctly with auto-commit

### CLI Interface Complete
- âœ… **Simplified Commands**: Eliminated confusing format options, single clear output
- âœ… **Standard Conventions**: Intuitive flag naming (`--verbose` vs `--tinylogfs`)
- âœ… **Advanced Filtering**: Partition, time range, and limit options
- âœ… **Performance Transparency**: Comprehensive I/O metrics and operation monitoring
- âœ… **Bug Detection**: Automatic identification of system anomalies

### Architecture Documents Complete & Validated
- âœ… **Clean Architecture Implemented**: Single source of truth successfully achieved
- âœ… **Bug Fixes Validated**: Duplicate record issue resolved and tested
- âœ… **Interface Streamlined**: User experience optimized for production use
- âœ… **Production Ready**: All core functionality tested and operational

## Integration Success
The replacement crates work together with a proven production architecture:

1. **TinyLogFS Production Architecture**: Clean two-layer design with persistence-backed directories
2. **Enhanced Query Capabilities**: DataFusion integration with comprehensive operation logging
3. **Simplified API**: Intuitive CLI commands with clear error messages and help text
4. **Local-first Implementation**: Delta Lake provides reliable persistence with Arrow IPC efficiency
5. **Arrow-native Processing**: Complete stack uses consistent Arrow data representation
6. **Production Reliability**: ACID guarantees, comprehensive testing, and real-world validation

## Current Focus
- **Production Deployment**: âœ… **READY** - All components tested and validated for production use
- **Documentation Creation**: System ready for user guides and API documentation  
- **Feature Development**: Solid foundation enables additional functionality development
- **Performance Optimization**: Baseline metrics established for monitoring improvements

## Technologies
- **Language**: Rust 2021 edition
- **Data**: Apache Arrow, Parquet, Delta Lake (delta-rs)
- **Query**: DataFusion, DuckDB (legacy)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem + cloud backup (S3-compatible)
- **Config**: YAML-based resource definitions
