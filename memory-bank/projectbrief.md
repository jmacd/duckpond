# DuckPond - Project Brief

## Project Overview
DuckPond is a "very small data lake" designed as a local-first, Parquet-oriented file system for timeseries data collection, processing, and analysis. The project consists of a proof-of-concept implementation (frozen) and new production-quality replacement crates.

## Core Mission
Build a local-first data system that:
- Collects timeseries data from environmental monitoring sources (HydroVu, LakeTech)
- Transforms data into standardized Arrow-based representations
- Stores data efficiently using Parquet format
- Enables fast querying and analysis using DuckDB/DataFusion
- Generates downsampled timeseries for web visualization
- Provides backup and restore capabilities

## Key Components

### Proof-of-Concept (./src) - FROZEN REFERENCE
- **Main binary**: Command-line interface for pond operations
- **Pond module**: Core data management with directory abstraction
- **HydroVu integration**: Environmental data collection from www.hydrovu.com
- **Backup/restore**: S3-compatible cloud backup system
- **Data pipeline**: YAML-driven resource configuration and processing

### Replacement Crates (./crates) - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#### 1. TinyFS Crate (`./crates/tinyfs`)
- **Purpose**: Virtual filesystem abstraction with pluggable storage backends
- **Architecture**: Backend trait system for clean separation of logic and storage
- **Core APIs**: `FS`, `WD` (working directory), `NodePath`, glob patterns
- **Advanced Features**: Dynamic directories via custom `Directory` trait implementations
- **Backend Architecture**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Pluggable storage system via `FilesystemBackend` trait
  - Core filesystem logic completely decoupled from storage implementation
  - `MemoryBackend` for testing and lightweight use (via dedicated `memory/` module)
  - Ready for `OpLogBackend` for persistent storage with Delta Lake
- **Key Innovation**: Clean architecture enabling different storage systems through dependency injection
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs unchanged, 22 tests passing

#### 2. OpLog Crate (`./crates/oplog`) 
- **Purpose**: Operation logging system using Delta Lake + DataFusion
- **Architecture**: Two-layer data storage (Delta Lake outer, Arrow IPC inner)
- **Features**: ACID guarantees, time travel, schema evolution, SQL queries
- **Status**: Implementation complete and tested

#### 3. CMD Crate (`./crates/cmd`)
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for pond management and operations
- **Features**: `pond init`, `pond show`, environment integration, error handling
- **Architecture**: Uses `clap` for CLI, integrates with TinyFS and OpLog
- **Status**: Core commands implemented and tested

#### 4. TinyLogFS Integration (`./crates/oplog/src/tinylogfs/`) - âœ… **PRODUCTION READY + ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION**
- **Purpose**: Arrow-native filesystem backend providing Delta Lake persistence for TinyFS
- **Architecture**: Complete implementation of `FilesystemBackend` trait with Arrow-native operations
- **Core Features**: 
  - **OpLogFile**: Direct Arrow IPC file operations with async content management
  - **OpLogDirectory**: Hybrid memory + persistent operations with query-based directory entry management
  - **OpLogSymlink**: Simple symlink persistence with Delta Lake operations
  - **OpLogBackend**: Full filesystem backend integration with partition design
  - **Root Directory Restoration**: âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Complete filesystem persistence across reopening
- **Partition Design**: Directories self-partitioned, files/symlinks parent-partitioned for efficient querying
- **Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - All 8/8 tests passing, complete on-demand loading functionality
- **Key Achievement**: Complete persistence architecture with on-demand loading, directory streaming, multi-backend support
- **Current Phase**: âœ… **COMPLETE** + ðŸ”„ **ARCHITECTURE REFACTORING** - Eliminating mixed responsibilities in TinyFS core

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT FOCUS: TinyFS Architecture Refactoring**

### Clean Layer Separation Project
Following the successful TinyLogFS implementation, we're now refactoring the TinyFS core architecture to eliminate mixed responsibilities and provide:

- **Memory-Bounded Caching**: LRU cache with configurable size limits
- **Directory Versioning**: Tombstone-based mutations preserving full history  
- **Clear Separation**: Pure persistence, cache, and coordination layers
- **NodeID/PartID Tracking**: Each node tracks its containing directory

### Architecture Documents Complete
- âœ… **fs_architecture_analysis.md**: Comprehensive analysis of current issues and proposed solutions
- âœ… **tinyfs_refactoring_plan.md**: Detailed phase-by-phase implementation plan  
- ðŸ”„ **Implementation Ready**: Ready to begin PersistenceLayer extraction

## Integration Vision
The replacement crates work together with a refined hybrid filesystem approach:

1. **TinyLogFS Hybrid Architecture**: Single-threaded design combining TinyFS in-memory performance with OpLog persistence using Arrow builder transaction state
2. **Enhanced Query Capabilities**: Real-time visibility of pending transactions through table provider builder snapshotting
3. **Simplified API**: Clear `commit()/restore()` semantics replacing complex sync operations
4. **Local-first mirroring**: Physical file copies synchronized from Delta Lake source of truth
5. **Arrow-native processing**: DataFusion provides efficient columnar query processing
6. **Improved reliability**: Delta Lake provides better consistency than individual Parquet files

## Current Focus
- **TinyFS Architecture Refactoring**: âœ… Analysis Complete - Designing clean layered architecture to eliminate mixed responsibilities  
- **Two-Layer Design**: âœ… Complete - PersistenceLayer + CacheLayer + FS coordinator with memory-bounded caching
- **Implementation Ready**: ðŸ”„ Next - Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with PersistenceLayer extraction
- **Directory Versioning**: âœ… Designed - Tombstone-based mutations for Delta Lake with full history preservation
- **NodeID/PartID Relationship**: âœ… Specified - Each node tracks containing directory in persistence layer

## Technologies
- **Language**: Rust 2021 edition
- **Data**: Apache Arrow, Parquet, Delta Lake (delta-rs)
- **Query**: DataFusion, DuckDB (legacy)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem + cloud backup (S3-compatible)
- **Config**: YAML-based resource definitions
