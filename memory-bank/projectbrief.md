# DuckPond - Project Brief

## Project Overview
DuckPond is a "very small data lake" designed as a local-first, Parquet-oriented file system for timeseries data collection, processing, and analysis. The project consists of a proof-of-concept implementation (frozen) and new production-quality replacement crates.

## Core Mission
Build a local-first data system that:
- Collects timeseries data from environmental monitoring sources (HydroVu, LakeTech)
- Transforms data into standardized Arrow-based representations
- Stores data efficiently using Parquet format
- Enables fast querying and analysis using DuckDB/DataFusion
- Generates downsampled timeseries for web visualization
- Provides backup and restore capabilities

## Key Components

### Proof-of-Concept (./src) - FROZEN REFERENCE
- **Main binary**: Command-line interface for pond operations
- **Pond module**: Core data management with directory abstraction
- **HydroVu integration**: Environmental data collection from www.hydrovu.com
- **Backup/restore**: S3-compatible cloud backup system
- **Data pipeline**: YAML-driven resource configuration and processing

### Replacement Crates (./crates) - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#### 1. TinyFS Crate (`./crates/tinyfs`)
- **Purpose**: Virtual filesystem abstraction with pluggable storage backends
- **Architecture**: Backend trait system for clean separation of logic and storage
- **Core APIs**: `FS`, `WD` (working directory), `NodePath`, glob patterns

- **Backend Architecture**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Pluggable storage system via `FilesystemBackend` trait
  - Core filesystem logic completely decoupled from storage implementation
  - `MemoryBackend` for testing and lightweight use (via dedicated `memory/` module)
  - Ready for `OpLogBackend` for persistent storage with Delta Lake
- **Key Innovation**: Clean architecture enabling different storage systems through dependency injection
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs unchanged, 22 tests passing

#### 2. OpLog Crate (`./crates/oplog`) 
- **Purpose**: Core operation logging system using Delta Lake + DataFusion
- **Architecture**: Two-layer data storage (Delta Lake outer, Arrow IPC inner)
- **Features**: ACID guarantees, time travel, schema evolution, foundational types
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Core delta and error types, clean architecture

#### 3. TLogFS Crate (`./crates/tlogfs`)

- **Features**: Complete filesystem implementation with SQL query access, ACID persistence
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Full implementation with structured query interface

#### 4. CMD Crate (`./crates/cmd`)
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for pond management and operations

- **Recent Updates**: Eliminated legacy commands, enhanced diagnostics, streamlined user experience

#### 4. TLogFS Integration (`./crates/oplog/src/tinylogfs/`) - ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY WITH MODERN ARCHITECTURE**
- **Purpose**: Arrow-native filesystem backend providing Delta Lake persistence for TinyFS with unified directory entry handling
- **Architecture**: Complete implementation of clean two-layer design with modern, legacy-free codebase
- **Core Features**: 
  - **OpLogPersistence**: Real Delta Lake operations with DataFusion queries and ACID guarantees
  - **Factory Function**: `create_oplog_fs()` provides clean production API
  - **Unified Directory Handling**: Single `VersionedDirectoryEntry` type throughout system
  - **Modern Schema**: Clean, consistent struct definitions without legacy dual-type confusion
  - **Single Source of Truth**: All operations flow through persistence layer, no local state
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive I/O metrics and operation tracking
- **Development Validation**: Core functionality tested, recent critical bug fixed
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN DEVELOPMENT** - Modern architecture with reliable file operations, UUID7 migration planned
- **Key Achievement**: Critical transaction metadata bug fixed, unified directory entry handling, enhanced CLI diagnostics
- **Current Phase**: üîß **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - Preparing for UUID7 migration for production readiness
