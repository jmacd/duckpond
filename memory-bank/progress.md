   - ✅ Created comprehensive integration test suite
   - 🔄 **CURRENT**: Resolving tinyfs API integration issues and dependency injection patterns

3. **TinyFS Crate API Evolution - CURRENT FOCUS**
   - 🔄 **DISCOVERED**: TinyFS crate needs public API refinement for first real-world use
   - 🔄 **DISCOVERED**: Root directory creation hardcoded to `MemoryDirectory` - blocking Delta Lake backend
   - 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Adding dependency injection pattern with `FS::with_root_directory()`
   - 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Making necessary APIs public while keeping test-only components private
   - 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Removing memory implementation dependencies from production code paths

   - ⏳ Query commands for filesystem history with real-time transaction visibility
   - ⏳ Backup and restore operations using enhanced table providers

## 📋 Planned Work (Next Phases)

### Phase 2: TinyLogFS Implementation - CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
1. **TinyFS API Architecture Issues - URGENT**
   - 🔄 **Root Directory Injection**: Need `FS::with_root_directory()` to replace hardcoded `MemoryDirectory::new_handle()`
   - 🔄 **Public API Refinement**: First real-world use requires making core APIs public while keeping test components private
   - 🔄 **Dependency Injection Pattern**: OpLogDirectory needs to be injectable as root directory for Delta Lake backing
   - 🔄 **API Method Gaps**: Missing methods on FS struct (working_dir, create_directory, etc.) needed by Phase 2

2. **Implementation Status**
   - ✅ **Core Phase 2 Modules**: All 6 modules implemented (error, transaction, filesystem, directory, schema, tests)
   - ✅ **Error Handling**: TinyLogFSError with Arrow-specific variants
   - ✅ **Transaction State**: Arrow builders for columnar operation accumulation  
   - 🔄 **API Integration**: Resolving mismatches between Phase 2 assumptions and actual TinyFS API
   - 🔄 **Compilation**: Multiple API compatibility issues preventing successful build

3. **Critical Decisions Needed**
   - 🤔 **NodeRef vs NodePath**: Phase 2 assumes NodeRef.id() method but it's on NodePath
   - 🤔 **Memory Component Usage**: MemoryFile/MemoryDirectory are test-only, Phase 2 needs Delta Lake-only paths
   - 🤔 **Public API Scope**: Which internal TinyFS types should be exposed vs kept private
