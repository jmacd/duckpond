## üìä **MEMORY BANK FILES STATUS**

| File | Status | Last Updated | Purpose |
|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| projectbrief.md | ‚úÖ Current | July 20, 2025 | Foundation and mission status |
| productContext.md | ‚úÖ Current | Previous | Problem statement and solution |
| activeContext.md | ‚úÖ Updated | July 20, 2025 | Current work and achievements |
| systemPatterns.md | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Update | July 18, 2025 | Architecture patterns (legacy content) |
| techContext.md | ‚úÖ Updated | July 20, 2025 | Technology stack and implementation |
| progress.md | ‚úÖ Updated | July 20, 2025 | Development progress and milestones |

**Note**: systemPatterns.md contains legacy content focused on large file storage. While accurate, it emphasizes development state rather than production achievement. Consider updating if architectural patterns documentation is needed.

## üéØ **CONCLUSION**

The memory bank update is complete and accurately reflects the DuckPond system's current production-ready status. The system has successfully achieved its core mission as a "very small data lake" and is ready for real-world use cases. All memory bank files provide accurate context for future development sessions, ensuring immediate productivity and proper understanding of the system's mature state.
