# Product Context - DuckPond Data Lake System

## Problem Statement
Environmental monitoring and timeseries data collection faces several challenges:
- **Data Fragmentation**: Data scattered across different systems and formats
- **Processing Complexity**: Complex pipelines needed for data transformation and downsampling
- **Access Speed**: Slow queries over large historical datasets
- **Local Dependency**: Need for reliable local storage with cloud backup
- **Visualization Requirements**: Fast page loads for web-based data exploration

## Solution Approach
DuckPond solves these challenges through a comprehensive local-first data lake:

### Core Philosophy: "Very Small Data Lake"
- **Local-first**: Primary data storage and processing happens locally
- **Parquet-oriented**: Columnar storage for efficient analytics
- **Arrow-native**: Consistent data representation throughout the pipeline
- **YAML-driven**: Declarative configuration for reproducible pipelines

### Data Collection & Integration
- **HydroVu Integration**: Direct API access to environmental monitoring data
- **Inbox System**: File-based data ingestion for various sources
- **Resource Management**: YAML-based configuration for data sources
- **Automated Scheduling**: Background data collection and processing

### Data Processing & Storage
- **Timeseries Standardization**: Convert diverse formats to common Arrow schema
- **Multi-resolution Downsampling**: Generate multiple time resolutions (1h, 2h, 4h, 12h, 24h)
- **Efficient Storage**: Partitioned Parquet files organized by time periods
- **Schema Evolution**: Support for changing data structures over time

### Query & Analysis
- **SQL Interface**: DuckDB for complex analytical queries
- **Fast Aggregations**: Pre-computed downsamples for quick visualization
- **Pattern Matching**: Glob-based file discovery and processing
- **Time Travel**: Historical data access and consistency

### Deployment & Backup
- **Static Website Generation**: Export data for Observable Framework
- **Cloud Backup**: S3-compatible storage for disaster recovery
- **Pipeline Reproducibility**: Complete configuration in version control
- **Resource Validation**: Consistency checks and data integrity verification
